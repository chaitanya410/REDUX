# REDUX
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It provides a centralized store that holds the state of your application and allows you to manage and update that state using actions and reducers. With Redux, you can create scalable and maintainable applications by enforcing a unidirectional data flow .
Redux for Food Cart is a practical implementation of Redux for building a food cart application. With Redux as the state management solution, this GitHub repository showcases how to efficiently handle the complex state requirements of a food cart, including managing items in the cart, calculating totals, and handling order submission.

By using Redux, the application achieves a centralized and predictable state management system, ensuring seamless synchronization between different components. The repository provides a comprehensive set of code examples, best practices, and reusable components tailored specifically for food cart scenarios.
